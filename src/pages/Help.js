              Welcome to our virtual try-on platform! Our website provides an
              innovative and user-friendly way to try upper body outfits from
              the comfort of your own home. Here's a helpful guide to help you
              get started: Upload your photo: The first step is to upload a
              photo of yourself. Make sure the photo is well-lit and shows your
              upper body clearly. You can choose to upload a photo from your
              computer or take a new one with your webcam
            </p>

              upper body outfits. You can filter your search by color, style,
              and size. Click on an item to see it on your virtual try-on model.
              Save and share: Once you've found the perfect outfit, you can save
